# Database

Paperclip uses PostgreSQL via [Drizzle ORM](https://orm.drizzle.team/). There are three ways to run the database, from simplest to most production-ready.

## 1. Embedded PostgreSQL — zero config

If you don't set `DATABASE_URL`, the server automatically starts an embedded PostgreSQL instance and manages a local data directory.

```sh
pnpm dev
```

That's it. On first start the server:

1. Creates a `~/.paperclip/instances/default/db/` directory for storage
2. Ensures the `paperclip` database exists
3. Runs migrations automatically for empty databases
4. Starts serving requests

Data persists across restarts in `~/.paperclip/instances/default/db/`. To reset local dev data, delete that directory.

If you need to apply pending migrations manually, run:

```sh
pnpm db:migrate
```

When `DATABASE_URL` is unset, this command targets the current embedded PostgreSQL instance for your active Paperclip config/instance.

Issue reference mentions follow the normal migration path: the schema migration creates the tracking table, but it does not backfill historical issue titles, descriptions, comments, or documents automatically.

To backfill existing content manually after migrating, run:

```sh
pnpm issue-references:backfill
# optional: limit to one company
pnpm issue-references:backfill -- --company <company-id>
```

Future issue, comment, and document writes sync references automatically without running the backfill command.

This mode is ideal for local development and one-command installs.

Docker note: the Docker quickstart image also uses embedded PostgreSQL by default. Persist `/paperclip` to keep DB state across container restarts (see `doc/DOCKER.md`).

## 2. Local PostgreSQL (Docker)

For a full PostgreSQL server locally, use the included Docker Compose setup:

```sh
docker compose up -d
```

This starts PostgreSQL 17 on `localhost:5432`. Then set the connection string:

```sh
cp .env.example .env
# .env already contains:
# DATABASE_URL=postgres://paperclip:paperclip@localhost:5432/paperclip
```

Run migrations:

```sh
DATABASE_URL=postgres://paperclip:paperclip@localhost:5432/paperclip \
  pnpm db:migrate
```

Start the server:

```sh
pnpm dev
```

## 3. Hosted PostgreSQL (Supabase)

For production, use a hosted PostgreSQL provider. [Supabase](https://supabase.com/) is a good option with a free tier.

### Setup

1. Create a project at [database.new](https://database.new)
2. Go to **Project Settings > Database > Connection string**
3. Copy the URI and replace the password placeholder with your database password

### Connection string

Supabase offers two connection modes:

**Direct connection** (port 5432) — use for migrations and one-off scripts:

```
postgres://postgres.[PROJECT-REF]:[PASSWORD]@aws-0-[REGION].pooler.supabase.com:5432/postgres
```

**Connection pooling via Supavisor** (port 6543) — use for the application:

```
postgres://postgres.[PROJECT-REF]:[PASSWORD]@aws-0-[REGION].pooler.supabase.com:6543/postgres
```

### Configure

For the application runtime, use a direct PostgreSQL connection unless the database client has explicit prepared-statement configuration for your pooling mode:

```sh
DATABASE_URL=postgres://postgres.[PROJECT-REF]:[PASSWORD]@aws-0-[REGION].pooler.supabase.com:5432/postgres
```

If you later run the app with a pooled runtime URL, set `DATABASE_MIGRATION_URL` to the direct connection URL. Paperclip uses it for startup schema checks/migrations and plugin namespace migrations, while the app continues to use `DATABASE_URL` for runtime queries:

```sh
DATABASE_URL=postgres://postgres.[PROJECT-REF]:[PASSWORD]@aws-0-[REGION].pooler.supabase.com:6543/postgres
DATABASE_MIGRATION_URL=postgres://postgres.[PROJECT-REF]:[PASSWORD]@aws-0-[REGION].pooler.supabase.com:5432/postgres
# Required with PAPERCLIP_DEPLOYMENT_PROFILE=multi_replica after verifying the endpoint contract:
DATABASE_MIGRATION_SESSION_CAPABLE=true
```

If your hosted database requires transaction-pooling-only connections (pgbouncer transaction mode, Supavisor port 6543, Neon `-pooler` endpoints), set `DATABASE_PREPARED_STATEMENTS=false` so the client does not rely on session-scoped prepared statements, and keep `DATABASE_MIGRATION_URL` on a direct connection. Do not edit database client source files as part of deployment setup.

Multi-replica deployments must also set `DATABASE_MIGRATION_SESSION_CAPABLE=true`. This is an explicit operator attestation that `DATABASE_MIGRATION_URL` reaches one stable PostgreSQL backend session for the lifetime of a connection and supports session advisory locks. PostgreSQL URLs do not encode pooling mode, so Paperclip fails unknown endpoints closed instead of guessing from provider hostnames or ports. Do not set this flag for PgBouncer/Supavisor transaction-pooling endpoints. `pnpm db:migrate` reads the same process environment, config-adjacent `.env`, and current-working-directory `.env` layers as server startup, with that precedence, including the same migration URL, profile, attestation, and lock-timeout contract. A defined blank or whitespace-only `DATABASE_URL` or `DATABASE_MIGRATION_URL` is an invalid override in both entrypoints; it fails closed instead of falling through to a lower-precedence database.

### Multi-replica migration coordination

Set `PAPERCLIP_DEPLOYMENT_PROFILE=multi_replica` before running more than one API replica. This profile refuses embedded PostgreSQL and requires both:

- `DATABASE_URL` for normal application queries; and
- `DATABASE_MIGRATION_URL` for a **direct, session-capable** PostgreSQL connection. Do not use a transaction-pooler endpoint for the migration URL; and
- `DATABASE_MIGRATION_SESSION_CAPABLE=true` as the explicit operator attestation for that endpoint contract.

Startup and `pnpm db:migrate` serialize migration inspection, migration-history repair, application, and final inspection with a stable PostgreSQL session advisory lock. A waiting replica re-inspects the schema after acquiring the lock; it never applies a stale pending-migration list. Logs expose only the hashed lock id and the states `waiting_for_migration_lock`, `migrating`, `ready`, or `failed`, never either connection string.

If the reserved PostgreSQL session closes, Paperclip records lost lock ownership, waits for the migration callback to settle, performs best-effort idempotent cleanup, and reports `failed` instead of issuing another query through the closed session. Reserved-session teardown uses postgres.js's forced one-second `end` timeout so backend-loss races cannot leave startup stuck in `migrating`. Migration callbacks are not generally cancellable, so session loss cannot stop DDL already running through separate clients; operators must treat the deployment as failed and verify database state before retrying.

`PAPERCLIP_MIGRATION_LOCK_TIMEOUT_MS` bounds how long startup waits (default: 10 minutes). Keep the Kubernetes startup-probe budget longer than this timeout plus the longest measured migration. If migration work fails, leave the deployment at one replica, fix or roll back the migration, and retry; do not bypass the lock or point the migration URL at a transaction pooler.

### Client tuning (optional)

All of these are optional; when unset, the driver defaults apply and behavior is unchanged — typical self-hosted setups need none of them:

```sh
DATABASE_PREPARED_STATEMENTS=false   # required for transaction-mode poolers; default: enabled
DATABASE_POOL_MAX=25                 # connection pool size; default: 10
DATABASE_IDLE_TIMEOUT_SECONDS=60     # close idle pooled connections; default: keep open
DATABASE_CONNECT_TIMEOUT_SECONDS=10  # default: 30
```

### Push the schema

```sh
# Use the direct connection (port 5432) for schema changes
DATABASE_URL=postgres://postgres.[PROJECT-REF]:[PASSWORD]@...5432/postgres \
  pnpm db:migrate
```

### Free tier limits

- 500 MB database storage
- 200 concurrent connections
- Projects pause after 1 week of inactivity

See [Supabase pricing](https://supabase.com/pricing) for current details.

## Switching between modes

The database mode is controlled by `DATABASE_URL`:

| `DATABASE_URL` | Mode |
|---|---|
| Not set | Embedded PostgreSQL (`~/.paperclip/instances/default/db/`) |
| `postgres://...localhost...` | Local Docker PostgreSQL |
| `postgres://...supabase.com...` | Hosted Supabase |

Your Drizzle schema (`packages/db/src/schema/`) stays the same regardless of mode.

## Connection pool timeouts

The application pool (`createDb()`) closes idle connections so a database-side *smart*
shutdown (failover, maintenance, CloudNativePG switchover) does not have to wait on
Paperclip. postgres.js defaults `idle_timeout` to `null`, i.e. an idle session is never
closed, so a smart shutdown blocks for its full timeout before escalating — measured as a
~181s primary outage for what should be a ~2s failover.

| Env var | Default | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `PAPERCLIP_DB_IDLE_TIMEOUT_SEC` | `30` | Close a pooled connection after this many seconds idle. `0` disables (postgres.js default / pre-fix behaviour). |
| `PAPERCLIP_DB_MAX_LIFETIME_SEC` | `1800` | Recycle a connection after this many seconds, even if busy. `0` disables. |

The defaults match the measured workload (bursty 30s heartbeat ticks, 0–2 concurrent
queries against a default pool of 10), so the pool drains shortly after the app goes quiet
instead of holding sessions open indefinitely.

One caveat on `max_lifetime`: postgres.js already bounds it by default, to a
*per-connection* random 30–60 minutes. Pinning the fixed 1800s above trades that jitter for
determinism, so a pool opened at startup expires together. If you see herd reconnects,
lengthen `PAPERCLIP_DB_MAX_LIFETIME_SEC` or set it to `0` to fall back to postgres.js's
jittered default.

## Migration authoring checklist

The 0126 issue comment attribution backfill showed the failure mode this checklist is meant to prevent: each batch looked for the next rows with an unindexed predicate, so PostgreSQL repeatedly scanned the same table and the migration became O(n²) as the table grew.

When authoring migrations or one-time backfills:

- Create the supporting index for the batch predicate before the backfill loop runs.
- Bound batches by an indexed key, such as an id range or keyset pagination cursor. Do not use `OFFSET` pagination or a query shape that re-scans already-visited rows each batch.
- Avoid unbounded full-table `UPDATE` or `DELETE` statements. Add a selective predicate and process rows in bounded batches when table size can be large.
- Use `CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY` for large existing tables when the migration can run outside a transaction and must avoid long write locks.
- Split schema changes, index creation, and data backfill into separate phases so each step has clear locking and rollback behavior.
- Treat the `check:migrations` CI gate as the enforcement backstop for these rules. If it flags a migration, rewrite the migration or add a suppression comment with the indexed predicate, batch bound, and reason the remaining scan is safe.

## Migration snapshots

`drizzle-kit generate` diffs `packages/db/src/schema/` against the newest snapshot in `packages/db/src/migrations/meta/`. That snapshot must describe the schema that every migration produces when they run in order. A snapshot that drifts from the schema makes the *next* migration wrong, because `generate` folds the drift into it. The drift can add a column that an earlier migration already created, which makes that migration fail on a fresh database. It can also drop a column that the schema still uses.

- Create every migration with `pnpm --filter @paperclipai/db generate`. Do not hand-write a snapshot.
- Do not hand-edit a snapshot to resolve a merge conflict. Renumber your migration and run `generate` again, as `packages/db/.gitattributes` describes.
- `packages/db/src/migration-snapshot-drift.test.ts` is the enforcement backstop. It repeats the diff that `generate` performs and fails when the newest snapshot no longer matches `packages/db/src/schema/`.

## Resource membership tables

Paperclip stores current-user sidebar membership state in:

- `project_memberships`
- `agent_memberships`

These rows are company-scoped and user-scoped. A missing row means the user is joined, so existing users keep seeing projects and agents in the sidebar until they explicitly leave them. Rows only control sidebar visibility; they do not affect project/agent detail access, all-pages, selectors, assignment flows, or existing company permissions.

Both tables use a unique key on `(company_id, user_id, resource_id)` and keep `state` as `joined` or `left`. Join/leave mutations are idempotent board-user `/me` operations and write activity entries when the effective state changes.

## Decision training snapshot retention

`decision_training_examples` stores a point-in-time copy of an issue, its comments, relevant runs, and the selected decision. Each row carries the `scrub_deleted_comments_v1` retention policy marker, and JSONL exports include that marker alongside the snapshot.

- Deleting a captured source comment transactionally replaces that comment in every affected snapshot with a content-free redaction tombstone. The original body, presentation, and metadata are not retained in the training record.
- Deleting an issue deletes its decision-training examples through the `issue_id` foreign-key cascade.
- Deleting a training example deletes only that example and does not mutate the source issue.

This policy makes training exports self-describing while keeping the decision record usable after a comment deletion without retaining content the author removed.

## Decision queues and triage provenance

The decisions desk stores queue membership, decide-by/snooze state, and retention state in `decision_queues`, `decision_queue_items`, `decision_triage`, and `decision_retention`. These sidecars use the stable attention identity `(source_kind, source_id)` so all attention source kinds can participate without copying source titles, bodies, projects, or other visibility-sensitive data.

`decision_triage_events` is append-only history for queue and triage changes. Current rows and history both carry server-derived user/agent, heartbeat run, API-key, and responsible-user attribution where applicable. Queue reads must resolve and authorize their source rows at read time; a sidecar row is never a visibility grant.

Triage writes serialize on the company and attention-source identity so concurrent partial updates preserve both fields and produce monotonic history versions.

`decision_retention` tracks the last observed source `activityAt`, Keep, reversible archive provenance, and monotonic source/archive versions. `decision_archive_notification_outbox` has a unique key over company, source identity, archive version, and immutable origin agent so repeated sweeps cannot enqueue duplicate notifications; delivery claims are retryable and coalesced per agent.

## Native runner persistence

Native runner state is additive to the existing heartbeat tables. Every existing
`heartbeat_runs` row defaults to `runtime_mode = 'legacy'`; adding these columns
does not select the native runtime or start a runner process. Native execution can
record its resolved runtime profile, provider session, driver, completion
contract, durable event cursor, and finalization phase on the run when a later
rollout explicitly selects it.

`completion_contracts`, `native_run_results`, `native_run_finalizations`,
`work_assessments`, `status_decisions`, and `status_decision_effects` form the
append-oriented evidence and status-decision chain. Unique fingerprints,
versions, ordinals, and idempotency keys make retries deterministic. Composite
foreign keys bind every contract, result, assessment, decision, effect, and
finalization to one company, issue, and run. The database rejects mixed-owner
evidence even when every referenced ID exists. Native source identities on
`heartbeat_run_events` are nullable so legacy events remain readable without
rewriting historical rows. Per-run native source identifiers are unique, while
the existing legacy sequence behavior remains unchanged. The hidden native
coordinator serializes on its bound `heartbeat_runs` row, allocates
`next_event_seq`, and commits a validated PRP event before the transport sends
its cumulative ACK. Byte-equivalent source retries return the existing cursor;
gaps and conflicting replays fail closed. Accepted structured results enter the
finalization ledger, whose retry time and owner lease are checked under a row
lock. None of these writes selects a runtime or changes a legacy run's execution
path.

Issue `status_version` advances only when `status` changes. The JavaScript backup
path includes user-defined functions and triggers so a restored database keeps
that invariant. Removing or disabling a future native rollout flag must not
delete these records; persisted experimental runs remain available for recovery
and inspection.

## Plugin database namespaces

The plugin runtime tracks plugin-owned database namespaces and migrations in `plugin_database_namespaces` and `plugin_migrations`. Hosted deployments that separate runtime and migration connections should set `DATABASE_MIGRATION_URL`; plugin namespace migration work uses the migration connection when present.

## Backups

Paperclip supports automatic and manual logical database backups. These dumps include
non-system database schemas such as `public`, the Drizzle migration journal, and
plugin-owned database schemas. See `doc/DEVELOPING.md` for the current
`paperclipai db:backup` / `pnpm db:backup` commands and backup retention
configuration.

Treat these logical dumps as a portable secondary recovery path, not as the primary
production disaster-recovery system. Production PostgreSQL should use a database-native
physical backup system with continuous WAL archiving, scheduled base backups, tested
point-in-time recovery, and independently enforced retention. For example, a
CloudNativePG deployment can use Barman Cloud to archive WAL and base backups to
S3-compatible object storage. Physical backups plus WAL are more space- and
recovery-efficient than repeatedly storing full logical dumps; the logical dump remains
valuable as a provider-independent escape hatch and for selective inspection.

Database backups do not include non-database instance files such as local-disk
uploads, workspace files, or the local encrypted secrets master key. Back those paths
up separately when you need full instance disaster recovery.

When shared object storage is configured, each completed local dump is also published
as an immutable system-scoped durable object followed by a verified JSON manifest. The
manifest records the exact object key, compressed byte length, SHA-256, and creation
time so another replica can materialize integrity-checked restore input without access
to the producing replica's backup directory. This publication does not replace WAL,
base-backup, or point-in-time-recovery tooling. Backup scheduling and retention ownership
remain part of the later HA fencing work.

## Durable object metadata

Shared object bytes are coordinated through `durable_objects`. Each committed row records
the configured backend identity, immutable object key, owning company or reserved system
scope, content type, byte length, SHA-256, optional backend version/ETag, and verification
state. Durable references may be published only after upload and verification commit.
Integrity failures move a row to `corrupt` with a visible reason. Successful backend deletion leaves a `deleted` tombstone so stale references cannot fall through to unversioned bytes at the same key.

See [Shared object storage](operations/object-storage.md) for provider requirements and the
remaining paths that keep multi-replica deployment blocked.

## Secret storage

Paperclip stores secret metadata and versions in:

- `user_secret_definitions`
- `user_secret_declarations`
- `company_secrets`
- `company_secret_versions`
- `company_secret_bindings`
- `secret_access_events`

Company secrets use `company_secrets.scope = 'company'` and are bound directly
through `company_secret_bindings`. User-specific secrets reuse the same provider
and version storage, but each value is a `company_secrets.scope = 'user'` row
with `owner_user_id` and `user_secret_definition_id` set. Definitions describe
the reusable company-level slot, declarations record where `user_secret_ref`
bindings are required, and the concrete value is selected later for the
responsible user.

Secret-aware env bindings are supported by agents, projects, and routines. Routine env lives in `routines.env`, is captured in `routine_revisions.snapshot`, and routine dispatches store `routine_runs.routine_revision_id` so runtime secret resolution uses the env snapshot that existed when the run was created. Routine secret refs bind with `target_type = 'routine'`, `target_id = routines.id`, and `config_path` values under `env.*`.

For local/default installs, the active provider is `local_encrypted`:

- Secret material is encrypted at rest with a local master key.
- Default key file: `~/.paperclip/instances/default/secrets/master.key` (auto-created if missing).
- CLI config location: `~/.paperclip/instances/default/config.json` under `secrets.localEncrypted.keyFilePath`.
- Backup/restore requires both the database metadata and the local master key file; either artifact alone is insufficient.
- The server best-effort enforces `0600` key file permissions and provider health reports permission warnings.
- User-scoped values use the same local encrypted provider path. Database
  backups preserve definitions, declarations, owner metadata, version metadata,
  and access events, but restored user-scoped values are decryptable only when
  the matching local master key is restored with the database.

Optional overrides:

- `PAPERCLIP_SECRETS_MASTER_KEY` (32-byte key as base64, hex, or raw 32-char string)
- `PAPERCLIP_SECRETS_MASTER_KEY_FILE` (custom key file path)

Strict mode to block new inline sensitive env values:

```sh
PAPERCLIP_SECRETS_STRICT_MODE=true
```

You can set strict mode and provider defaults via:

```sh
pnpm paperclipai configure --section secrets
```

Inline secret migration command:

```sh
npx paperclipai secrets migrate-inline-env --company-id <company-id> --apply

# direct database maintenance fallback
pnpm secrets:migrate-inline-env --apply
```
