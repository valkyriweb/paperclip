/**
 * Regression test for a production incident (2026-08-18).
 *
 * enqueueWakeup throws for per-agent gate failures. The most common one in practice is the
 * budget hard-stop, which surfaced as this line every 30s in server.log:
 *
 *   ERROR: heartbeat timer tick failed
 *     err: { "type": "HttpError",
 *            "message": "Agent cannot start because its budget hard-stop is still exceeded.",
 *            stack: ... at enqueueWakeup ... at async Object.tickTimers }
 *
 * tickTimers had no per-agent guard, so a single over-budget agent aborted the entire sweep:
 * every agent ordered after it silently stopped receiving heartbeats, and tickDueIssueMonitors
 * never ran at all. The failure was permanent, because a hard-stopped budget does not clear on
 * its own.
