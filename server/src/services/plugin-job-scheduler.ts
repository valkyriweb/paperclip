/**
 * PluginJobScheduler — tick-based scheduler for plugin scheduled jobs.
 *
 * The scheduler is the central coordinator for all plugin cron jobs. It
 * periodically ticks (default every 30 seconds), queries the `plugin_jobs`
 * table for jobs whose `nextRunAt` has passed, dispatches `runJob` RPC calls
 * to the appropriate worker processes, records each execution in the
 * `plugin_job_runs` table, and advances the scheduling pointer.
 *
 * ## Responsibilities
 *
 * 1. **Tick loop** — A `setInterval`-based loop fires every `tickIntervalMs`
 *    (default 30s). Each tick scans for due jobs and dispatches them.
 *
 * 2. **Cron parsing & next-run calculation** — Uses the lightweight built-in
 *    cron parser ({@link parseCron}, {@link nextCronTick}) to compute the
 *    `nextRunAt` timestamp after each run or when a new job is registered.
 *
 * 3. **Overlap prevention** — Before dispatching a job, the scheduler checks
 *    for an existing `running` run for the same job. If one exists, the job
 *    is skipped for that tick.
 *
 * 4. **Job run recording** — Every execution creates a `plugin_job_runs` row:
 *    `queued` → `running` → `succeeded` | `failed`. Duration and error are
 *    captured.
 *
 * 5. **Lifecycle integration** — The scheduler exposes `registerPlugin()` and
 *    `unregisterPlugin()` so the host lifecycle manager can wire up job
 *    scheduling when plugins start/stop. On registration, the scheduler
 *    computes `nextRunAt` for all active jobs that don't already have one.
 *
 * 6. **Expiry reconciliation** — A second `setInterval` loop (default 60s,
 *    independent of the tick loop) sweeps occurrences whose lease has
 *    genuinely expired (DB clock, plus a grace period) and takes each one
 *    over via `takeoverExpiredOccurrence`, settling it at the terminal
 *    `"unknown"` outcome. This never re-dispatches the job — see
 *    plugin-job-claims-store.ts's module doc for why blind replay is unsafe.
 *    Without this sweep, an occurrence whose worker crashed mid-lease (no
 *    completion write, no acknowledgement-revoke) would stay `running`
 *    forever.
