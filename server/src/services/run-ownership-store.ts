/**
 * Durable leased ownership + monotonic fencing for heartbeat runs
 * (active-active reforge plan 003).
 *
 * The in-process `runningProcesses`/`activeRunExecutions` maps and
 * `withAgentStartLock` can only coordinate within one Paperclip process. This
 * store makes ownership of a running heartbeat run a fact in PostgreSQL:
 *
 * - `ownerToken` identifies the executor that currently holds the run.
 * - `fence` is a value minted from the global `heartbeat_run_fence_seq`
 *   sequence on every claim/takeover. Fence values are strictly increasing
 *   across the whole table.
 * - `leaseExpiresAt`/`leaseRenewedAt` bound how long a claim is presumed
 *   live. Expiry is a signal for reconciliation to investigate and make the
 *   loss operator-visible; it is NOT proof the previous holder stopped
 *   writing (a wedged process can outlive its lease). That is why every
 *   mutation is fenced on (ownerToken, fence) rather than trusting expiry
 *   alone.
 *
 * ## Correctness contract
 *
 * A caller is authorized to mutate a run's durable state ONLY while holding
 * an `{ ownerToken, fence }` pair that was minted for it — by
 * `claimHeartbeatRunSlot` (fresh claim) or `claimExpiredLease` (takeover) —
 * and never mutated afterward by the caller. Every write helper here
 * compares BOTH columns: `owner_token = $ownerToken AND fence = $fence`.
 * Comparing fence in addition to the (already globally-unique) owner token
 * is deliberate defense in depth: it also catches a caller that reused a
 * stale in-memory `run` row whose `ownerToken` field it forgot to refresh,
 * since the row's `fence` moves on every takeover even when a bug elsewhere
 * left the `ownerToken` field aliased.
 *
 * A caller MUST capture `{ ownerToken, fence }` exactly once, at the moment
 * it wins a claim/takeover, into an immutable binding, and thread that same
 * value through every subsequent write for the run's execution — never
 * re-read `ownerToken`/`fence` off a later `SELECT` of the row and pass that
 * back in as if it were still "mine". A later `SELECT` reflects whoever
 * currently owns the run, which after a takeover is no longer the caller.
 *
 * Every mutation helper here returns null (not throw) on a 0-row CAS
 * result, mirroring the compare-and-swap idiom already used by
 * heartbeat.ts's setRunStatusFromLive. Never throwing) means "I was
 * superseded" is an expected, cheap-to-check outcome, not an exception path.
